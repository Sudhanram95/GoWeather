# GoWeather
GoWeather is an android application written in kotlin. This application will show the current temperature and the forecasted temperature of the locality you resides.

# Architecture
I have followed MVP architectural pattern. Some frameworks such as Retrofit and rxJava are used for efficient API calls. Testing frameworks such as Mockito, Espresso and JUnit were also used for writing test cases.

# Conclusion
Hope you all like GoWeather. Awaiting for your feedbacks.
